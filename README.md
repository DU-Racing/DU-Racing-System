# du-racing
This script allows any race track owner or event organiser set up and manage a race system that has many features to make managing races over any distance possible with multiple racers.

## Features

* Organiser mode - Plot the waypoints while flying around the track, save them locally and test it, then broadcast it to the central system.
* Test mode - Set the test track key in the params and run the track without an official race being set.
* Race mode - Registers racer with central system and awaits signal to start. Records times on leaderboards.
* Central System - A central system that records all race data and stores tracks ready for races. Leaderboards for track and lap times.
* Waypoint race system - Waypoints are set automatically and checked off as you go through them.
* Multiple tracks - Save multiple tracks in your central system for easy switching on events.
* Multiple racers - Allows multiple racers to take part in the same race.
* Team and Color system on ships - Set your team name and color on the ships to automatically set the light colors on the ship and for leaderboards.
* Supports multiple laps - Races can consist of 1 or more laps.
* Text command system - Lua chat text command system to help with managing the data in the databanks and exporting data.
* Custom Race UI - Useful data overlays and UI elements for the race system, including toast notifications.
* Race key system - Official races use a race key that is shared with racers to register them in the race.
* Track sharing system - Allows the tracks on the central system to be broadcast to racers. 
* Multipart message broadcasts - Large datasets are broken down in to smaller chunks to be emitted properly.
* Broadcast message queue system - Ensures messages are not lost from overloading receivers and allows a larger volume of data and racers to be handled.

## Upcoming Features

* Ship classification - Automatically classify a ship for racing based on the components fitted.

## DU Racing Official Events
To take part in DU Racing official events, with prizes and long standing leaderboards, you will need to purchase a pre-made ship or core with the system pre-loaded. This ensures no manipulation of the scripts can take place and keeps eveything equal.
