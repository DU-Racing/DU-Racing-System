## Databanks providers
Some tracks provide free ships but those that don't you'll need to either buy the appropriate ship (which by BP or token will included the needed databank info) or install the race script on an appropriate vehicle.  Acquire them from one of these locations or from someone on the discord.  Databank BPs can come on a XS core with Programming board and sometimes a screen with info about their contents.
> Tip: Copy databanks with this script: [DB Duplicator on github](https://github.com/asc2030/du-duplicate-databank)
